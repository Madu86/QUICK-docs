About QUICK QM Package
======================

Quick is a linear scaling ab initio and density functional theory program for calculation of energies, 
charges and geometries of systems up to ~3,000 atoms. Available features include:

• Single point ab initio and density functional theory calculations (LGA, GGA and Hybrid-GGA functionals
  available).
• Gradient and geometry optimization calculations (LBFGS solver available)
• Mulliken charge analysis

The program was originally developed by Ed Brothers. His work includes the development of the standard 
Hartree-Fock and density functional theory energy and gradient calculations, geometry optimization routines, 
Mulliken charge analysis, strategy and front end of the program. Ken Ayers and Xiao He optimized the code.
Yipu Miao implemented the GPU enabled ERI engine and provided basis for GPU capable DFT calculations.
